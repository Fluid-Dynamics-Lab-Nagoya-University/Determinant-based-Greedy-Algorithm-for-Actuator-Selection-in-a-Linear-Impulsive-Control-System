# Determinant-based-Greedy-Algorithm-for-Actuator-Selection-in-a-Linear-Impulsive-Control-System
This repository contains MATLAB R2024a codes of determinant-based greedy algorithm for actuator placement optimization in a linear impulsive control system.

## Codes
- P_act_opt_one_initial_cond.m: Main code to optimize actuator locations and compute the repsponse for one initial condition
- P_act_opt_multi_initial_cond.m: Main code to optimize actuator locations and evaluate its effectiveness with multiple initial conditions
- F_act_dg_under1.m:
